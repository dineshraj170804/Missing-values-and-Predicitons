This project focuses on detecting and predicting missing values in a housing dataset using Python. 
We leverage libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn for data preprocessing, visualization,
and machine learning-based imputation.
1. Identifying Missing Values

Use pandas to detect missing values in the dataset.

Visualize missing values using matplotlib.

2. Handling Missing Values

Simple imputation techniques (mean, median, mode).

Advanced imputation using Machine Learning (Linear Regression, KNN, etc.).

3. Evaluating Predictions

Mean Squared Error (MSE) for accuracy assessment.

R-squared (R^2) score to measure model performance.
